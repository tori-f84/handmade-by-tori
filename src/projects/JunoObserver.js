const joDescMD = `
Junocam is an instrument onboard NASA's [Juno spacecraft](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/), which is currently orbiting Jupiter and sending back new imagery every month
and a half as it reaches 'perijove' - it's closest point to the planet. I've written my own processing pipeline for this [image data](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing)
(which I'll soon be re-writing, open-sourcing, and documenting here), and Juno Observer (a [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) web-app) is my way of displaying the results.

It allows you to browse all of the available perijove data, projected onto a 3D representation of Jupiter, giving context to the imagery
in a way that wasn't previously possible.

The live version of the app uses imagery from the original version of my processing pipeline, which has since vastly improved. I'm also currently about
75% of the way through a complete re-write of the app, which already contains a lot more features, thanks to the fact that is now uses
the same base structure as [AreoBrowser](./projects/areo-browser).
