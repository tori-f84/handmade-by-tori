Lovely, medium sized teardrop ring. Handmade using hand-mined chrysoprase from Western Australia and stirling silver.

I love the colour of these stones and put in extra time to make backless bezels, so the light can shine through and really show off the stone. 
The stone itself is almost perfect, with a little white inclusion to remind you it's a real stone.
