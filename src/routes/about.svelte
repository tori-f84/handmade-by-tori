  <p class="mt-6">In my ‘other life’, l've been working for a marine conservation organisation, and have been fortunate enough to travel to many far-flung places, all of which have the sea in common. For me, the ocean has been a life-giver and constant source of inspiration, including for my designs.</p>
  <p class="mt-2">I use a lot of chrysoprase chalcedony in my pieces and first fell in love with this stone on a trip to New Zealand. I now source my stones from a family-run small mine in Western Australia, where the stones are hand-cut and hand-finished to a very high quality. Each piece I make with these stones is one of a kind, due to the unique nature of every stone.  The Ancient Greeks considered chrysoprase to be the sacred stone of Aphrodite, whose sacred colour was green and it remains a highly sought-after stone. </p>
  <p class="mt-2">To show-off the beautiful stones, my preferred setting is backless, which takes a little longer to create, but I hope you will agree it is worth it to show off the variations on both sides of the stones - often the back is as beautiful as the front!</p>

  <h2 class="mt-12 text-xl sm:text-2xl sm:font-thin text-toriAccent tracking-wide pb-2">Postage and packaging</h2>
  At the moment I am only shipping to the UK but contact me if you are overseas and would like to purchase or commission an item and find out postage costs. I use recycled packaging wherever possible to try and minimise waste, so don’t be surprised if you get a jiffy bag that originated from Australia!
  Some items are made to order and this will be stated on those items, otherwise items are sold as seen. 

  <h2 class="mt-6 text-xl sm:text-2xl sm:font-thin text-toriAccent tracking-wide pb-2">Returns and refunds</h2>
  Please contact me first if you have any problems with your order. I accept returns within 14 days (excluding earrings) as long as the item is in its original state. Returns must be tracked and postage paid for by the customer - unless there is a fault with the item. My payments are taken through paypal so you also receive standard paypal protection.
