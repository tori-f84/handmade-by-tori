desc: I have a terrible habit of never writing about the things I make. This site is my attempt to fix that...

(Ironically it took me ages to even begin writing this, although my brain is [admittedly](https://www.trusselltrust.org/coronavirus-food-banks/) and [understandably](https://england.shelter.org.uk/donate) somewhat [distracted](https://www.goodsamapp.org/nhs) right now...)

Up to this point, I've been absolutely awful at writing about my personal projects. Whether it's space data processing, plotter code writing, or [ZOIA](https://empresseffects.com/products/zoia) format deciphering, I've shared almost exactly no details about how or why I'm doing any of it. Due to a somewhat miscalibrated belief that things I create need to be _perfect_ before I send them out into the world, I err on the side of saying nothing whatsoever (with the main exception being [Areo Browser](./projects/areo-browser), a site that I'm immensely proud of, but also deem _finished_ enough to be a _complete product_ that can be safely be presented as such).

The other reason is that it's always been too tricky to simply share things. I've had a few personal sites in the past, but none of them made it _easy enough_ to share code, data, live [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)/WebGL content, or tutorials in the way that I wanted.

Which brings me to _this_ post on _this_ new site. Written using [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it finally gives me a way to write the probably short, almost-certainly incredibly niche posts that have been swirling around in my brain for the last few years.

Going forwards, my goal is to write more often (it's a low bar), open source as much code as possible, and try to become more comfortable with not waiting until a project is _finished_ before sharing it.

I think this site is a good start. I mean there's not even article tags yet... ðŸ˜¬
